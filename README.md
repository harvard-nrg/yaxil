YAXIL: Yet another XNAT interface library
=========================================
Yaxil is an XNAT interface library that started a long time ago in a galaxy far, 
far away. It works with Python 3.4+ and XNAT 1.4 through 1.8. There are simple 
functions for querying XNAT, searching for MRI scans, downloading scan data 
and assessments, all while smoothing over various aches and pains along the way.
